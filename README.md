# Patterns
Short examples to the famous patterns in Software Engineering

## Interface
An interface defines methods which a class must implement. Later those implementations can be passed back to the interface for better abstraction.

## Delegation
Adding some functionality from another class.

* From the inside: by instantiation of class
* From the outside: over the constructor or a method param
